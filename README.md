## ARIMA <br>

<br> Basic ARIMA model on a single product at one location using exhaustive search and best pick manual model comparison. High MAE for prototype model for around 30 products.
As ARIMA can't be optimized for MAE but only for RMSE, the model is not found to be very efficient for the product demand forecasting here.<br> <br>
